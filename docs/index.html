        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Civic AI Debater</strong> is a research-based platform that presents civic issues through debates between two AI agents rather than a single chatbot, promoting balanced deliberation and reducing algorithmic bias in democratic participation. While traditional AI-assisted civic engagement tools rely on single chatbot interactions that may reinforce existing biases, this project explores whether presenting multiple perspectives through AI debates can lead to more informed and balanced decision-making. The platform demonstrates how deliberative AI architectures can enhance civic discourse by exposing users to diverse viewpoints and counterarguments, potentially reducing over-reliance on single AI perspectives in democratic processes.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dual-AI Debate Format.</strong> Two AI agents present opposing perspectives on civic issues, ensuring users are exposed to balanced viewpoints rather than a single potentially biased response.</li>
          <li><strong>Comparative Study Design.</strong> The platform allows users to experience both single-chatbot and dual-debate formats, enabling research on which approach leads to better-informed civic decision-making.</li>
          <li><strong>Bias Reduction Mechanism.</strong> By presenting multiple perspectives simultaneously, the system helps users develop more nuanced understanding of complex civic issues and reduces the risk of algorithmic bias.</li>
          <li><strong>Interactive Civic Engagement.</strong> Users can explore real civic topics through structured debates, fostering critical thinking and deliberative reasoning in AI-assisted democratic participation.</li>
        </ul>
