        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used by citizens to understand public and political issues, yet AI tools can subtly shape opinions through biased framing. This project explores whether exposing users to a structured debate between two AI agents leads to a more balanced understanding of a given topic than interacting with a single AI assistant. Using a small, in-person prototype study with Master's students in AI for Sustainable Societies, we designed, tested, and iteratively refined a web-based application. We combined in-app confidence ratings, post-experience surveys, and direct observation to explore how interaction design shapes perceived understanding and trust. The project follows a design-thinking approach, moving from problem framing to prototyping and early evaluation, with further iteration identified as future work.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dual-AI Debate Format.</strong> Two AI agents present opposing perspectives on civic issues, ensuring users are exposed to balanced viewpoints rather than a single potentially biased response.</li>
          <li><strong>Comparative Study Design.</strong> The platform allows users to experience both single-chatbot and dual-debate formats, enabling research on which approach leads to better-informed civic decision-making.</li>
          <li><strong>Bias Reduction Mechanism.</strong> By presenting multiple perspectives simultaneously, the system helps users develop more nuanced understanding of complex civic issues and reduces the risk of algorithmic bias.</li>
          <li><strong>Interactive Civic Engagement.</strong> Users can explore real civic topics through structured debates, fostering critical thinking and deliberative reasoning in AI-assisted democratic participation.</li>
        </ul>
